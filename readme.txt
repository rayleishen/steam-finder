Requires python 3

Made for steam, but can easily be modified for other websites.
A line count of 334 simply means that its an empty steam page without an account.
Value should be changed accordingly for other sites.

data.txt should be modified to your prefered parameters.
Currently, it contains all 4 digit english words recognized by scrabble.

I'd suggest this to generate random strings:

Please don't be stupid and run 50 instances of this on a bunch of computers
for whatever reason. This was made simply for my personal convenience.

What I mean is, don't DDOS steam :/
